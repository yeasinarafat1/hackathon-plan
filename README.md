## **Project Title**: Transparency Portal  

**Purpose**:  
The Transparency Portal is designed to fight corruption by allowing citizens to report incidents of misconduct anonymously and track the progress of their complaints. It’s a simple, secure platform aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in governance.

---

### **Key Features (For Hackathon Version)**

1. **Anonymous Reporting**:
   - Users can fill out a simple form to report corruption cases without logging in.
   - The system generates a unique **Complaint ID** for each submission.

2. **Complaint Tracking**:
   - Users can check the status of their complaint by entering the unique Complaint ID.
   - Status updates (like "Submitted," "Under Review," "Resolved") will give users confidence in the process.

3. **Admin Dashboard (Optional/Stretch Goal)**:
   - A basic dashboard where an admin can view all complaints and change their statuses.

---

### **Tech Stack (Optimized for Hackathon)**

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Framework**: React.js or Next.js (for faster development and deployment).
   - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (quick and responsive UI).

2. **Backend**:
   - **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight and easy to set up).
   - **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database or SQLite (minimal setup and easy integration).

3. **Deployment**:
   - **Frontend**: Vercel (free and fast deployment for React/Next.js apps).
   - **Backend**: Render (easy to deploy Node.js apps with free tiers).

4. **Tools for Collaboration**:
   - **GitHub**: Version control and project tracking.
   - **Trello/Notion**: For task management.

### **Project Flow**

#### **Step 1: User Reports Corruption**
- User visits the portal and fills out a complaint form with:
  - **Type of corruption** (e.g., bribery, fraud).
  - **Details** (what, where, and when).
  - **Optional attachment** (e.g., a photo or document).
- The system stores the complaint in the database and generates a unique **Complaint ID**.

#### **Step 2: User Tracks Complaint**
- Users can check the status of their complaint using the Complaint ID on a separate page.
- Status options (e.g., Submitted, Under Review, Resolved) help keep the user informed.

#### **Step 3: Admin Reviews Complaints (Optional for Hackathon)**
- Admin logs in to view all complaints in a simple dashboard.
- They can update the status of complaints (e.g., from “Under Review” to “Resolved”).

### **Team Roles (Two Members)**

1. **Frontend Developer**:
   - Build the user interface for the complaint form and status-checking page.
   - Style the app using Tailwind CSS to save time.
   - Deploy the frontend on Vercel.

2. **Backend Developer**:
   - Set up the server with Express.js.
   - Create API endpoints:
     - `POST /complaints` for submitting complaints.
     - `GET /complaints/:id` for retrieving complaint status.
   - Use Firebase or SQLite for data storage.
   - Deploy the backend on Render.

### **Development Plan (10 Hours)**

#### **Hour 1-2: Planning and Setup**
- Set up GitHub repository and development environments.
- Decide on API structure and database schema.
- Set up basic frontend and backend skeletons.

#### **Hour 3-5: Core Development**
- **Frontend**: 
  - Build the complaint form and tracking page.
  - Integrate API calls for submitting and tracking complaints.
- **Backend**:
  - Create endpoints for handling complaint submissions and retrieval.
  - Connect the database and test data storage/retrieval.

#### **Hour 6-7: Testing**
- Test the frontend and backend integration.
- Ensure data flows correctly and complaints are retrievable.

#### **Hour 8-9: Polishing**
- Add basic validation for complaint forms (e.g., required fields).
- Style the app with Tailwind CSS for a clean look.

#### **Hour 10: Deployment and Final Testing**
- Deploy the app on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).
- Test the deployed version to ensure everything works as expected.

### **Sample Database Structure**

#### Complaints Table:
| Field           | Type          | Description                              |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | String (UUID) | Unique ID for the complaint.            |
| `type`          | String        | Type of corruption (e.g., bribery).      |
| `details`       | Text          | Description of the incident.            |
| `status`        | String        | Complaint status (e.g., Submitted).      |
| `createdAt`     | Timestamp     | Date and time of submission.             |

---

### **Sample API Endpoints**

1. **Submit Complaint**:
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /complaints`
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "Bribery",
       "details": "Officer demanded extra fees for approval."
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "12345",
       "status": "Submitted"
     }
     ```

2. **Track Complaint**:
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /complaints/:id`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "12345",
       "type": "Bribery",
       "details": "Officer demanded extra fees for approval.",
       "status": "Under Review",
       "createdAt": "2025-01-26T10:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

## **Project Title**: Transparency Portal

**Purpose**:  
The Transparency Portal provides a secure and efficient platform for citizens to report corruption. It supports both anonymous and non-anonymous reporting while ensuring privacy, transparency, and accountability. Users must create accounts to submit complaints, and anonymous reports are designed to prevent personal data from being linked to complaints unless optional contact information is provided.

----------

### **Key Features**

1.  **User Accounts**:
    
    -   All users must create an account (username/password or email/password).
    -   User authentication ensures secure access to the platform.
    -   Anonymous submissions do not link user details to the complaint, maintaining privacy.
2.  **Anonymous Reporting**:
    
    -   Users can submit complaints without attaching any identifiable personal data to the complaint.
    -   **Optional Contact Information**: Users may provide a secure email address, allowing authorities to request additional information without revealing their identity.
3.  **Non-Anonymous Reporting**:
    
    -   Users can link their complaints to their accounts.
    -   Notifications are sent to users via email or SMS whenever the status of their complaint changes (e.g., “Under Review,” “Resolved”).
    -   Provides full transparency and accountability for the reporting process.
4.  **Anonymous Complaint Tracking**:
    
    -   Anonymous users receive a unique **Complaint ID** to track the status of their submission.
    -   Tracking ensures users stay informed about the progress of their complaint while preserving anonymity.
5.  **Spam Prevention with reCAPTCHA**:
    
    -   Google reCAPTCHA is implemented to block spam and bot submissions.
6.  **AI Integration**:
    
    -   An **OpenAI model** classifies complaints by severity (critical, moderate, minor) and generates summaries for administrators.
    -   Ensures quicker prioritization and resolution.
7.  **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**:
    
    -   Admins can:
        -   View all complaints, their statuses, and AI-assigned severity levels.
        -   Use filters to prioritize complaints by severity and type.
        -   Send email inquiries to users (if optional email was provided for anonymous complaints).
        -   Notify non-anonymous users about updates or resolutions.
    -   Real-time analytics and insights on complaint trends.

## Project Flow

#### **Step 1: User Account Creation**

1.  User creates an account via email/password or username/password.
2.  Authentication ensures secure access to complaint submissions and tracking.

#### **Step 2: Complaint Submission**

1.  User selects:
    -   **Anonymous Complaint**: Complaint is not linked to their account.
    -   **Non-Anonymous Complaint**: Complaint is linked to their account.
2.  User fills out the complaint form with:
    -   **Type of corruption** (e.g., bribery, fraud).
    -   **Details** (what, where, when).
    -   **Optional Email Address** (for anonymous complaints).
    -   **Optional attachment** (photo/document).
3.  **reCAPTCHA** ensures submissions are from real users.
4.  System processes the complaint:
    -   Stores it in the database.
    -   Generates a unique **Complaint ID** for tracking.

#### **Step 3: AI Classification and Summarization**

1.  OpenAI processes the complaint:
    -   Classifies it by severity (critical, moderate, minor).
    -   Summarizes the details for efficient admin review.

#### **Step 4: Tracking and Notifications**

1.  **Anonymous Users**:
    -   Use their unique **Complaint ID** to track status on a public tracking page.
2.  **Non-Anonymous Users**:
    -   Receive notifications (via email/SMS) when the status changes.
    -   Option to view complaint history and updates within their account dashboard.

#### **Step 5: Admin Review and Follow-Up**

1.  Admin accesses the dashboard with features to:
    -   View complaints along with AI-generated severity and summaries.
    -   Filter complaints by severity, type, or status.
    -   Update complaint statuses (e.g., "Under Review," "Resolved").
    -   Contact users via email for additional information (if provided).

----------

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **Privacy for Anonymous Complaints**:

-   Anonymous complaint data is stored without any account linkage.
-   Optional email addresses for follow-ups are encrypted and only visible to authorized admins.

#### **Notification Mechanism**:

-   For non-anonymous users:
    -   Notifications include status changes and resolution updates.
    -   Email/SMS options are configurable during complaint submission.
-   For anonymous users with email:
    -   Admins can send inquiries for additional information via secure, one-way communication.
